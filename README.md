# Development setup

## Prerequisites

1. Install the following software

    - [OpenJDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    - [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/learning/)
    - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
    - [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

## Development setup

### Clone the orcid-member-services repository

Create a `git` directory in your home folder, and clone the orcid-member-services project there:

- mkdir ~/git
- cd ~/git
- git clone git@github.com:ORCID/orcid-member-services.git

### Start the JHipster UAA services

[JHipster UAA](https://www.jhipster.tech/using-uaa/) is the service we use to secure our member services, it consists on three different applications:

- The JHipster [registry](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry)
- The JHipster [gateway](https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/)
- The JHipster [oauth2-service](https://www.jhipster.tech/using-uaa)
    
So, the first thing we should do is starting the different JHipster services as follows:   

1. Start the JHipster registry:

    - Open a new terminal 
    - cd orcid-member-services/jhipster-registry/
    - Run `bash mvnw`
    - Wait for it to start
    - Go to (http://localhost:8761/#/)[http://localhost:8761/#/] and sign in with the admin credentials `admin / admin`

2. Start the JHipster gateway:
    
    - Start MongoDB
    - Open a new terminal 
    - cd orcid-member-services/gateway/    
    - Run `bash mvnw`
    - Wait for it to start
    - Go to (http://localhost:8080/)[http://localhost:8080/] and sing in with the admin credentials `admin / admin`

3. Start the oauth2-services

    - Open a new terminal 
    - cd orcid-member-services/oauth2-service/  
    - Run `bash mvnw`
    - Wait for it to start

At this point, all required services are up and running, time to setup the `user-settings-service` and `assertion-services` and start working on them.

- User settings service configuration [here](USER_SETTINGS_SERVICE.md)
- Assertion services configuration [here](ASSERTION_SERVICES.md)

You would also want to look at the docker configuration for [local development](DOCKER_CONFIG.md)
